[Julia Gersey][julia-gersey] is an undergraduate Computer Science and Applied Math Student. She enjoys building various IoT projects, rock climbing, and coffee.

*Proudest accomplishment*: Summiting [Old Rag Mountain][old-rag-mtn] at 3,284 feet via a 9 mile hike and rock scramble. It was an extreme mental and physical challenge, making it my favorite hike by far.
